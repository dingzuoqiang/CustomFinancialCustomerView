# FinancialCustomerView

## Introduce
> This project will simulate the various views in financial transaction software, provide detailed implementation ideas, and collect relevant algorithms, documents and professional materials.

## Significance
> May our developers to say, have very mature third party framework, why return to oneself to realize?

* Knowing how to write and draw, it is more convenient to extend the third library graphics library.
* Understand the principle of implementation, if the third parties can not achieve, you can write one in a leisurely way.
* There are many kinds of algorithms and various indicators in financial transactions, but there are few related information on the Internet. I hope can give a little help to financial related developers.
* Knowing it, knowing it is so.
